# create nodes for each value
# perform possible operations, creating nodes for new values, with an (operator+number) edge between them
# loop through and create these edges on all existing nodes up to 'choices' times
# loop through nodes from 1-999, or all original nodes?
# move through edges, outputtinng the path each time a node is within 101-999
